            <div class="content ps-0 ps-lg-5">
              <p class="fst-italic" style="color:#212529;">
                Founded in September 1988 by John Doe in England, UK, Our Company began as a small operation with six trucks and twelve trailers. John, having developed a passion for trucking while working at LTL providers like Hammel’s Express and PITT OHIO, built the company on hard work and dedication to service.
                During the 1990s, the company expanded across the Mid-Atlantic region, offering truckload and LTL services. By 1999, with 10 terminals and a new headquarters in Chicago, UK, it launched a Logistics division to serve customers nationwide through a strategic partner network.
                In 2007, Our Company introduced on-board computing systems in its tractors, allowing customers to track their freight in real-time and receive critical updates.
                Today, the company operates over 350 tractors and 1300 trailers across 14 terminals, offering flexible, customized logistics solutions to meet complex supply chain needs.
